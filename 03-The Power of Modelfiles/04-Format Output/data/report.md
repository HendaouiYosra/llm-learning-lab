# Course Equivalency Report

# **Similarities:**

Both courses are categorized under the subject of computer science and have a focus on data structures and algorithms. They share similar topics such as arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, hashing, and dynamic programming. Additionally, both courses assess students' understanding through midterms, finals, projects, and assignments.

# **Differences:**

**Course 1:**  
- Title: Data Structures & Algorithms
- Credits: 3

**Course 2:**  
- Title: Advanced Data Structures
- Credits: 4

While the overall scope of topics is comparable, Course 2 places more emphasis on advanced concepts like dynamic programming. Additionally, Course 1 has a shorter course length (3 credits) compared to Course 2 (4 credits). Both courses emphasize learning through assessment methods that include midterm exams, finals, projects, and assignments.

# **Conclusion:**

These two courses are not equivalent for credit transfer purposes due to differences in the number of credits awarded (3 vs. 4) and the depth of topics covered (advanced concepts vs. standard data structures). However, since both courses cover similar foundational material regarding arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, sorting, hashing, and dynamic programming, they may still be considered equivalent for some institutions' purposes when assessing credit transferability.
