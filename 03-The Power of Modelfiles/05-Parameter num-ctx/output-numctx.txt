    One day, Benny found a shiny red apple under a big oak tree. He was so happy! But just as he was about to take a bite, a gust of wind rolled the apple down a hill.

    "Oh no!" Benny cried and ran after it.

    The apple rolled faster and faster. Benny hopped as quickly as he could, but the apple was too fast. It rolled into a small cave at the bottom of the hill.

    Benny stopped outside the cave. It was dark inside, and he felt a little scared. But he really wanted his apple. So, he took a deep breath and stepped inside.

    Inside the cave, Benny saw glowing fireflies lighting up the walls. Their tiny lights flickered like stars, making the cave look magical. In the middle of the cave sat a friendly old turtle, wearing a small pair of glasses.

    "Hello, little bunny," said the turtle with a warm smile. "Are you looking for something?"

    "Yes!" Benny said. "My apple rolled in here."

    The turtle chuckled. "Ah, I see! It stopped right by my shell."

    He nudged the apple toward Benny. The bunny’s eyes lit up with joy.

    "Thank you so much!" Benny said.
